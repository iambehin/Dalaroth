"
My name is Gal, welcome to Vahth, friend.
I see you are an adventurer, I'm afraid we are not a warriour people.
However, these are dark times, and even peaceful villagers need protection.
On behalf of the villagers of Vahth, I have a request for you.
Our grass has had an evil enchantment cast upon it, by The Witch.
It no longer grows peacefully and pads our feet, but throws acid at us.
We have lost many a life to this grass, and cannot grow crops safely.
Farmers require an escort merely to plant crops.
"
</p>
"
Will you escort my friend, Ahlon to his field, and keep guard while he collects his crop?
"
